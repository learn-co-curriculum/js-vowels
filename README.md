## Objective

Create a function `isAVowel` that accepts one argument, a letter. If the letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), the function shoulw return true. If not, it should return false.

For the purposes of this lab, you can choose to do what you will with the letter `y`. The test suite is indifferent to it.

## Examples

Here are some examples:

```javascript
isAVowel("a")
// => true


isAVowel("x")
// => false
```

## Instructions

Run the test suite to get started. Remember that JavaScript will return `undefined` unless you explicitly tell it to return something.

OR

Open index.html and use the form to check your code. Remember to refresh the page when you save your JavaScript.
